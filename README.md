# mobile/tablet app from the [LifeChoices project](https://github.com/devlabalsace/LifeChoices) (Xamarin 4.4+)

## First version: based on Xappy from David Ortineau

We are working on a new gallery app for all of us to enjoy. The app should:

* Be A Collaboration - join us as we iterate through the design, user experience, and implementation.
* Be Gorgeous - Xamarin and Xamarin.Forms are being used every day to create top notch apps. Let's show that!
* Be Modern - Xamarin.Forms is shipping new features to make it easier than ever to deliver current user experience.
* Be Useful - Rather than just a static gallery, the app should be useful as a tool for your to keep up to date with the steady stream of happenings in our open source community.
* Be Ready - At Build 2019!
